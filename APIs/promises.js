//A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
//A promise allows Javascript to handle 'asynchronous' code, which takes an indeterminate amount of time. Once the async process has run, the promise resolves or rejects.

})

promise         //.then handles a resolved promise and processes the value passed along from the promise. .catch handles a 
                //rejected promise and the value passed to it.

    .catch(err => console.log(err));    //err -'failure'
